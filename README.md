# ClearAI
We are building a Clear AI UI that turns complex AI workflows into transparent, explainable discussions. It presents experiments, data, models, and results in a unified interface, enabling clear reasoning, reproducibility, and collaboration. The system abstracts infrastructure while making decisions and outcomes easy to understand.

Abstract

Modern AI systems deliver high performance but remain difficult to understand, validate, and trust. This lack of transparency limits adoption in high-stakes decision-making and hinders effective model evaluation. This work presents a clear and transparent AI framework that enables model quality assessment and trust by transforming complex AI workflows into structured, human-readable explanations. The framework captures experiments, data models, decisions, and outcomes as standardized explanation artifacts, decoupled from underlying infrastructure. These artifacts are visualized through a mobile-first, narrative-driven interface that communicates what was executed, why it was executed, and what the results imply. By focusing on interpretability, reproducibility, and accessibility, the framework supports researchers, engineers, and decision-makers in understanding model behavior, identifying failure modes, and monitoring changes over time. The proposed approach emphasizes modularity and scalability, allowing integration across diverse model types while preserving technical depth without relying on fragmented logs or scripts.
